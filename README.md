## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project I have used the Seattle AirBNB homes data to offer a high-level overview over the data and to answer the following questions:
1.	How can we describe the Seattle accommodation offer?
2.	Can we predict the price established for an accommodation based on the facilities listed by the host?
4.	What factors seem to have a strong impact in receiving a Superhost badge?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
1. Database - stores the Seattle AirBNB homes data (can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data?select=listings.csv)).
2. AirBNB_Seattle - containts the code used to obtain all the results for the questions listed above.
3. Images - stores the images file used for this project.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
I would like to give credit to AirBNB for the database used for this study. You can  find the Licensing for the data and the descriptive information on the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data?select=listings.csv). 
Feel free to use my code and maybe take a look at the blog post mentioned above.
